# Packer For Docker

The code in this repository is used to build the public Docker images hosted at [frostedcarbon/packer-for-docker][]. These images have Packer and Docker installed. These can serve as the base image for further-customized private images, which can then be used to build and publish Docker images with Packer as part of an automated development pipeline.
